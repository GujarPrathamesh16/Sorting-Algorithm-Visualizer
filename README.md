# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a small python project to visualize the flow of different sorting algorithms and  traces the changes occurring in the position of elements of the array.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Visualization of major sorting algorithms using Python Library ‘Tkinter’.
## EXPLANATION OF PROJECT
Various sorting algorithms are present and many of which are taught in colleges, but
even if the teacher tries their best to make the students explain, it always lacks a vital
element i.e visualization. So here we present our group project SORTING
ALGORITHMS TRACER.
## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND TOOLS USED
This project uses a python standard GUI library 'Tkinter'. The Tkinter module helps in
creating GUI applications in a fast and easy way.
Some common ones are Buttons, Labels, Frames, Menus. The message, Radio button,
Text, Scrollbar, and so on.
Some of the advantages of using Tkinter include -
Tkinter provides three geometry managers: place, pack, and grid. That is much
more powerful and easy to use.
Tkinter is more flexible and stable.
It has standard attributed dimensions, fonts, colours, cursors, anchors, and bitmaps
for a better GUI.

### The output window while performing sorting (in this case Bubble Sort with SLOW as speed parameter) →

## PROJECT OUTCOME
Through this assignment, we were able to successfully create a project using Tkinter in
Python.
By using Tkinter Library of python we learnt the use of Tkinter to display graphical
figures of data sets like charts and other figures and manipulation of these figures.
This project also cleared the concepts of sorting and we also understood the flow of
different sorting algorithms through visualization of these sorting algorithms.
Also while working on this project we learnt and developed various qualities like working
in a team, Time Management, etc. leading to the successful and timely completion of
the assignment.
